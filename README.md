# isMathTools

A C/C++ Library for general-purpose mathematical operations and helpers packaged as a library for (but with code that does not depending on) Arduino.

This library's maintainer is Jeff Russ, for Imagisound LLC, and contains code written by GPT-4o. 

Of note within this library is an implementation of a polynomial fitting algorithm, `polyfit`, which is very close to the function of the same name found in `numpy`.
